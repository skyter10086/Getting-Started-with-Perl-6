## Writing kernels for Jupyter.

There are two ways of writing kernells for Jupyter.
One way is to write native kernel from the scratch or making python wrapper kernels.

I have compiled all the videos that would be helpful for anyone trying to write kernels for Jupyter in their favorite programming language.

For making native kernels, it is essential to have binding for [zeromq](http://zeromq.org/) in your language of choice.

See one video on [ZeroMQ here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JCBphyciAs).

Enjoy writing **kernels**!!
