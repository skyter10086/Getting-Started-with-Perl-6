## Installing Perl 6 on Linux (Debian)

The best and easiest way is to use your package manager.
`apt-get install rakudo `

To build it from source in your Linux box, see [here](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo#building-and-installing-rakudo).


## Installing Perl 6 on Windows 

##### Go to [perl6.org](https://perl6.org/)

Click `Download` on topmost bar.

Then go to [https://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/star/](https://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/star/)

Select the latest `*.msi` file and install in your system.

**The rakudo itself changes the PATH.**

## Installing Perl 6 on MacOSX

Similar steps as Windows but select `*.dmg` file

---

To see if Perl 6 correctly installed check it in terminal or command-prompt by typing:
`perl6 -v`.

Something like this will be shown:
`This is Rakudo version 2017.04.3 built on MoarVM version 2017.04-53-g66c6dda
implementing Perl 6.c.`
